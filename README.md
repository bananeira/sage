This homepage is a small personal project that I have been working on for some time. It is intended to present my interests and serves as some sort of portfolio to showcase and collet my activities and soft skills, that I have acquired.

I hope you enjoy browsing through the site and learning more about me and my interests. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting!
